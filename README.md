- 👀 I’m interested in different areas of technology, I want to learn as much information as possible;
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java, C and information systems; 
- 🎀🐰  Fun fact: I like making slides on Canva, because I can choose something I like and put it on them, with relevant texts;
- okay... I also like to play games, I admit;
